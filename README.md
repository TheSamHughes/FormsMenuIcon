I'm trying to build a cross-platform app using C# and [Xamarin.Forms][1]. It
contains a slide-out menu implemented in form of a [MasterDetailPage][2]. While
on Android there is a button with the app icon in the top left corner, which
toggles the slide-out page, there is no such navigation bar item on iOS.
